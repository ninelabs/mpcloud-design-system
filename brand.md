# MP Cloud Brand Identity

The MP Cloud brand identity has two colors: [Primary Pink](../colors.html) and [Dark Pink](../colors.html). The "N" Solo Mark is the primary visual mark for most uses. These elements and their relationship must never be altered or modified in any way.

### Proper Spacing

The required space surrounding the logo mark is equal to the height distance between the words "NINE" and "LABS". Spacing should be measured from the edge of the words, not the edge of the separator line.
