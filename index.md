# MP Cloud Design System

#### Brand and style guidelines for building MP Cloud and EMTech digital products.

----

### Getting Started

The entire system is based on [Twitter Bootstrap 4.4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/), and extends many of its core concepts.

----

### CSS only

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//designsystem.ninelabs.com/assets/style.css" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

<a href="/assets/style.css" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Download the CSS</a>

### Content and Components

Explore the documentation for how we use our [Brand Logo](brand.html), our [Brand Colors](colors.html), [Typography](typography.html), and a limited set of [custom components](components.html) we use to build Nine Labs digital products.

You can also explore a few [Example Pages](examples.html) to see how everything fits together.
