### Quotes

We use “smart” (curly) quotes, instead of "dumb" (straight) quotes. “Smart” quotes improve readability by making it obvious where the quote begins and ends - "dumb" quotes do not. Be smart with ‘single’ and “double” quotes.

**Avoid**

- 'single'
- "double"

**Use**

- ‘single’
- “double”
